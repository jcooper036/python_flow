This is a quick flow cytometry demo using FSCparser [https://github.com/eyurtsev/fcsparser].  
  
Libraries required (use `pip install [name]` to get them if you don't have them).
- fscparser
- pandas
- matplotlib

The primary file is a jupyter notebook. I highly recomend running the code there - much of cell sorting is visual, and it helps to be able to see the plots in the code.  
  
Sample of finding GFP- and GFP+ cells.
